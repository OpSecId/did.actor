User Experience and Development Personas for Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials.

### [Alice, did:web:did.actor:alice](./alice)
### [Bob, did:web:did.actor:bob](./bob)

#### Motivation

It's often desirable to have Test DIDs that are readable, and that might have some additional context that is useful to lean on for development. By using github and did:web, we can provide such dids and everything needed to support them.
