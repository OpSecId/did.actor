#### Motivation

It's often desirable to have Test DIDs that are readable, and that might have some additional context that is useful to lean on for development. By using github and did:web, we can provide such dids and everything needed to support them.

#### About DID Web

You can learn more about [did:web here.](https://did-web.web.app/)

Note that this demo uses experimental `did:web` functionality not currently supported by the Universal Resolver.
